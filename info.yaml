      The following diagram shows the workflow of the circuit. 

      Puts the bottom 8 bits of the counter on the bidirectional outputs.

# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed

      After reset, the counter should increase by one every second with a 10MHz input clock.
